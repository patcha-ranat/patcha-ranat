## End-to-end project (DE/DS/DA/MLOps)
- üöÄ[**Ecommerce-Invoice-End-to-end**](https://github.com/patcha-ranat/Ecommerce-Invoice-End-to-end)
    - An end-to-end data project, including designing data architecture, setting up a containerized local environment for ETL processes, enabling Terraform (IaC) for cloud services, conducting EDA with Python, creating PowerBI dashboard visualizations, developing supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, and implementing a continuous deployment (CD) workflow with GitHub Actions.
        - Implemented tools such as Airflow, Docker, and Terraform to perform local ETL process extracting data from APIs (OAuth 2.0 and RestAPI), and Postgres database, then transforming and loading to Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, BigQuery, and Redshift both in Native Table and External Table approaches.
        - Deployed FastAPI and a Docker container on Cloud Run via Google Artifact Registry (GAR), while also implementing an automated deployment process through a CD pipeline orchestrated by GitHub Actions workflow.
        - Developed RFM model plus Feature Engineering to segment customers into clusters utilizing KMeans algorithms, then verified the criteria of segmentation with the Decision Tree resulting in 10 clusters, 89.41% explainable by the Tree together with important features from XGBoost.
    - Tools:
        - PowerBI | Docker | Airflow | Terraform | PostgreSQL | IAM | GCS | BigQuery | S3 | Redshift | Google Artifact Registry | Cloud Run | FastAPI | Github Actions | API OAuth 2.0 | RestAPI | Decision Tree | RFM | KMeans | Market Basket Analysis | XGBoost | LightGBM

## Data Engineering project
- üëç[de-pyspark-airflow](https://github.com/patcha-ranat/de-pyspark-airflow)
    - Data Ingestion of local parquet files to docker postgresDB using PySpark integrated with Airflow orchestrated by docker-compose.
        - Custom Airflow Operator written in OOP.
        - Extended official airflow docker image by installing pyspark and necessary dependencies (JAVA, JDBC jar file, and python package).
- [TD-Test](https://github.com/patcha-ranat/TD-test)

## Machine Learning projects
- üëç[MLOps-ml-system](https://github.com/patcha-ranat/MLOps-ml-system) - *In progress...*
- üëç[ML-Learning](https://github.com/patcha-ranat/ML-Learning)
    - Machine learning experiment for learning purpose.
    - Algorithm & ML development/evaluation research and note.
- üëç[Big-Data-for-Energy-Management](https://github.com/patcha-ranat/Big-Data-for-Energy-Management)
    - The project introduced understanding of the machine learning model development process, such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, models' algorithm, mostly tree-based models, model evaluation and other techniques such as early stopping, imputation, data pre-processing, and feature engineering.
    - The energy demand inference from regression model can also be used further to cluster the similar energy consumption patterns which might be useful for us knowing the future energy consumption.
